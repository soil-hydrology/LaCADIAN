# Louisiana Climate and Digital Ag Network (LaCaDIAN)

This is an upcoming network of distributed automated field observatories of in-situ and proximal sensors 
to record critical-zone water-energy-carbon fluxes in Mississipi River Alluvial Plains of Louisiana.

The first LaCaDIAN node was operationalized at Doyle Chambers Central Research Station (Ben Hur) in 
December 2024, and has since provideded continuous real-time, high fidelity soil and climate data for the 
location.

This network is intended to aid in monitoring, modeling and managing regional agriculture, energy,
biodiversity, soil health,and water resources.
